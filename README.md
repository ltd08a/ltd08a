# Hello! My name is Logan Donlan

## The Journey
From an early age I felt a pull to serve those around me. I did so by joining the U.S. Army in 2011 as a communications technician. I quickly gained the respect of my peers and superiors. After reaching the rank of Sergeant and completing my second combat deployment to Afghinistan I decided to fulfil my initial contract and move on to a new step in my journey. Like many veterans I found the transition difficult. I spent the next few years trying to build connections that were as meaningful as the ones I had made in the military and trying to find my passion. Once I began school at Western Governor's University I realized that my analytical thought process was perfect for the growing field of data analytics. It has taken some time, but I now feel like I have a great sense of direction for my life.

## Currently
I am working my way to my bachelor's degree in Data Analytics and will be graduating in the spring of this year. I am currently working as a captain at Brennan's of Houston where I effectively communicate with a wide range of clients. I came into this job with no experience in the fine dining industry, but quickly grew to be one of the top performers on the team. This experience has given me the opportunity to hone my communication skills, as I have to tailor each interaction with guests to meet the specific needs and wants of those in front of me on a nightly basis. 

## Outside Interests
I love sports. The NBA and NFL are constantly in the back of my mind. I read the box scores of each game every night trying to see who is performing well, who is underperforming, and trying to find trends. Being outdoors, away from the noise of the city, is also a passion of mine. There's a certain level of connectedness that can only be felt when you truly disconnect. I find that reading is a great way to disconnect when you can't get out of the city. I read almost every night, whether it be some type of self improvement guide or a fantasy series. 

## Connections
I am currently looking to connect with people in the data realm to gain insights from this amazing field. Find my LinkedIn here https://www.linkedin.com/in/logan-donlan-4b490bb0/
